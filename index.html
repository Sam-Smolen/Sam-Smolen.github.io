    <h1>Parakeets</h1>

    <h2>Natural Habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Parakeets are navtive australians that prefer mild-warm climates. Hundreds
      of parakeet species populate regions like Asia, Africa, Australia and
      Central/ South America. Typically each species evolves to adapt to local
      climates, but with extreme climate change can wipe a whole generation of
      parakeets (Source:

      >). Ideal climate temperature ranges 60 - 70 deg during the day and can
      withstand up to almost 40 deg at night. These resourceful birds use local
      resources to provide food (seeds from grass and crops) and water (Source:

    <h2>Captive Habitat</h2>
    <p>
      Med-sized cages are ideal size for indoor parakeets. There needs to be
      enough space for birds to fly short distances. Cage environments that
      simulate branches and tall grass are great for these birds. If the cage is
      too small, they will need to be brought outside so they can stretch their
      wings and play. Large aviaries exist to house multiple birds and allow pet
      owners to interact with them (Source:
