  <h1>Parakeets</h1>
  <h2>Sounds</h2>

  <p>Parakeets are known as one of the most vocal members of the parrot family. They have the ability to reproduce sounds that they hear and can develop quite large vocabularies. Whistling, chirping, and singing are all signs that a parakeet is happy and healthy. Chattering is also a sign of contentment, in addition males use chattering to gain attention and affection from females. Don’t be concerned if you hear your pet parakeet grinding its beak, it’s quite normal and is a way to comfort themselves before falling asleep. Chiding is a hiss or “tssk” and is used to indicate its space is being invaded. When multiple birds are in a cage, they will often use this sound to indicate they need more personal space. Squawking or loud chirping can be an indication that something is wrong, but it could also mean a male is ready to mate. Lastly, if you hear a parakeet screaming they may be in distress or pain. </p>

  <h2>Parakeet Identification</h2>
<p> There are several species of parakeets, but the most commonly known in the United States is the budgie or budgerigar. Parakeets are actually a subspecies of parrots, though usually much smaller. The sizes can range from 7 to 18 inches, and they are noted for have a long tail which is about half of their total length. Parakeets are a popular pet but they can also be found in the wild. The most common seen are mostly green or blue in color. </p>
<p> You can tell if they are male or female by looking at the color of their cere, which is the lumpy part at the base of the beak. Males have blue or purple ceres, and the females have a pink or light brown cere. It may be hard to tell until the bird is about 1 year old. To be absolutely sure, you may need to have a DNA test done, because the bird’s sex organs are hidden inside the body. </p>

  <h1>Predators</h1>
  <p>The parakeet has many threats in the wild that it must deal with on a daily basis.  The main threats that they face are larger species of birds called raptor birds, such as eagles or falcons, as well as different species of snakes. Occasionally, even feral cats or rodents will raid nests for food or to steal the eggs of the parakeet. In an effort to avoid some of these predators, invasive parakeets in certain regions will even nest with a large bird called the stork, with which they share a symbiotic relationship.  While all of these threats can be potentially deadly to the parakeet, it tends to be wary and stay out of the way, thus keeping itself largely out of danger when compared to other species of bird.</p>

      Parakeets are navtive australians that prefer mild-warm climates. Hundreds
      of parakeet species populate regions like Asia, Africa, Australia and
      Central/ South America. Typically each species evolves to adapt to local
      climates, but with extreme climate change can wipe a whole generation of
      parakeets (Source:

      >). Ideal climate temperature ranges 60 - 70 deg during the day and can
      withstand up to almost 40 deg at night. These resourceful birds use local
      resources to provide food (seeds from grass and crops) and water (Source:

      Med-sized cages are ideal size for indoor parakeets. There needs to be
      enough space for birds to fly short distances. Cage environments that
      simulate branches and tall grass are great for these birds. If the cage is
      too small, they will need to be brought outside so they can stretch their
      wings and play. Large aviaries exist to house multiple birds and allow pet
      owners to interact with them (Source:
