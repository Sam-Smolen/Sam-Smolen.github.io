  <p>Parakeets are known as one of the most vocal members of the parrot family. They have the ability to reproduce sounds that they hear and can develop quite large vocabularies. Whistling, chirping, and singing are all signs that a parakeet is happy and healthy. Chattering is also a sign of contentment, in addition males use chattering to gain attention and affection from females. Don’t be concerned if you hear your pet parakeet grinding its beak, it’s quite normal and is a way to comfort themselves before falling asleep. Chiding is a hiss or “tssk” and is used to indicate its space is being invaded. When multiple birds are in a cage, they will often use this sound to indicate they need more personal space. Squawking or loud chirping can be an indication that something is wrong, but it could also mean a male is ready to mate. Lastly, if you hear a parakeet screaming they may be in distress or pain. </p>
  <h2>Parakeet Identification</h2>
<p> There are several species of parakeets, but the most commonly known in the United States is the budgie or budgerigar. Parakeets are actually a subspecies of parrots, though usually much smaller. The sizes can range from 7 to 18 inches, and they are noted for have a long tail which is about half of their total length. Parakeets are a popular pet but they can also be found in the wild. The most common seen are mostly green or blue in color. </p>
<p> You can tell if they are male or female by looking at the color of their cere, which is the lumpy part at the base of the beak. Males have blue or purple ceres, and the females have a pink or light brown cere. It may be hard to tell until the bird is about 1 year old. To be absolutely sure, you may need to have a DNA test done, because the bird’s sex organs are hidden inside the body. </p>
  <h2>Parakeet Migration & Feral Parakeets</h2>
  <p>Parakeets do not migrate, though many species travel long distances in pursuit of more advantageous feeding conditions. Monk parakeets have been tracked in their travels from southern Argentina to Bolivia, spanning of over 1500 miles of natural habitat.</p>

  <p>Feral parakeets in North America present an interesting example of the species' traveling habits. Escaped birds have created parakeet communities across the United States. The map below shows the known ranges of common feral parakeets.</p>
