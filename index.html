  <p>Parakeets are known as one of the most vocal members of the parrot family. They have the ability to reproduce sounds that they hear and can develop quite large vocabularies. Whistling, chirping, and singing are all signs that a parakeet is happy and healthy. Chattering is also a sign of contentment, in addition males use chattering to gain attention and affection from females. Don’t be concerned if you hear your pet parakeet grinding its beak, it’s quite normal and is a way to comfort themselves before falling asleep. Chiding is a hiss or “tssk” and is used to indicate its space is being invaded. When multiple birds are in a cage, they will often use this sound to indicate they need more personal space. Squawking or loud chirping can be an indication that something is wrong, but it could also mean a male is ready to mate. Lastly, if you hear a parakeet screaming they may be in distress or pain. </p>
